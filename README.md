# The truth is more important than everâ€”let's make sure easy privacy protection is available.

Differential privacy should be simple. Now that data defines our world, we need to look at the cost of privacy. Let's make protecting privacy easy [(not like this!)](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf).

# What is differential privacy and how can I start protecting privacy?

Differential privacy allows for data to be preserved while making sure that attackers cannot gain access to an individual's data. Even if you publish summary statistics (like average age of participants, unlabeled addresses of participants, etc.), attackers can gain access to *individual* data (like age of *each* participant, *labeled* addresses of participants, etc.). In order to achieve this, differential privacy slightly changes the actual dataset to make sure that any uncovered data will not give away personal information. See below for how to get started!
